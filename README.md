# zealous-rutabaga
For the times when you are too lazy to open Visual Studio just to build a project/solution.


Adds a "build" action to the Windows context menu. For the times when you just want to build a solution; be it another branch or just a program you want to rebuild and run without needing to open your IDE of choice.
